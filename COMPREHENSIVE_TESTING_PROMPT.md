# üéØ COMPREHENSIVE TESTING & VERIFICATION PROMPT FOR NEXT AGENT

## üìã **MISSION:**
Verify that ALL database features, user interactions, and profile functionality work perfectly end-to-end. Test likes, comments, saves, user profiles, and blog interactions with the database (SQLite local / MySQL production).

---

## üóÑÔ∏è **PHASE 1: DATABASE VERIFICATION**

### **Task 1.1: Verify Database Connection**

**For SQLite (Local Development):**
```bash
# Check if database file exists
ls -la /app/backend/julian_portfolio.db

# Connect to database and verify tables
sqlite3 /app/backend/julian_portfolio.db "SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table';"

# Expected output: 6 tables
# - blogs
# - contact_info  
# - user_profiles
# - blog_likes
# - blog_saves
# - blog_comments
```

**For MySQL (Hostinger Production):**
```bash
# Test API health endpoint
curl http://localhost:8001/api/health

# Expected: {"status":"healthy","database":"MySQL","timestamp":"..."}
```

### **Task 1.2: Verify Table Structures**

Run these SQL queries to check table structures:

```sql
-- Check blogs table
SELECT * FROM blogs LIMIT 1;

-- Check user_profiles table  
SELECT * FROM user_profiles LIMIT 1;

-- Check blog_likes table
SELECT * FROM blog_likes LIMIT 1;

-- Check blog_saves table
SELECT * FROM blog_saves LIMIT 1;

---

## üîß **PHASE 7: TROUBLESHOOTING COMMON ISSUES**

### **Issue 1: "User not found" Error**

**Symptoms:**
- User logs in successfully
- Profile menu actions fail
- API returns 404 "User not found"

**Diagnosis:**
```sql
-- Check if user profile was created
SELECT * FROM user_profiles WHERE email = 'user@example.com';
```

**Solution:**
- Sign out and sign in again
- User profile should auto-create on login
- Check backend logs for errors during user creation

---

### **Issue 2: Likes/Saves Not Persisting**

**Symptoms:**
- Click like/save button
- Icon changes
- But after refresh, state is lost

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check API response
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/blogs/1/like \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -v
```

**Check Database:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM blog_likes WHERE blog_id = 1;
```

**Solution:**
- Verify token is valid
- Check database write permissions
- Verify foreign key constraints exist
- Check backend logs for SQL errors

---

### **Issue 3: Comments Not Showing**

**Symptoms:**
- Post comment
- Shows success message
- But comment doesn't appear

**Diagnosis:**
```sql
-- Check if comment was created
SELECT * FROM blog_comments WHERE blog_id = 1 ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Check if it's soft deleted
SELECT * FROM blog_comments WHERE is_deleted = 1;
```

**Solution:**
- Verify comment text is not empty
- Check if user_id and blog_id are correct
- Ensure comment fetch query excludes deleted comments
- Check frontend API call and response parsing

---

### **Issue 4: Profile Pages Redirect to Homepage**

**Symptoms:**
- Click profile menu item
- URL changes
- Immediately redirects to homepage

**Diagnosis:**
- Open browser DevTools Console
- Look for authentication errors
- Check if `authLoading` state is handled

**Solution:**
- This should be fixed already (see NAVIGATION_FIX_APPLIED.md)
- Verify pages wait for `authLoading` to complete
- Check if user token is in localStorage
- Clear browser cache and try again

---

### **Issue 5: Database Connection Errors (MySQL)**

**Symptoms:**
- "Can't connect to MySQL server"
- API returns 500 errors
- Backend logs show connection failures

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check backend logs
tail -f /var/log/supervisor/backend.*.log | grep -i mysql

# Check environment variables
grep MYSQL /app/backend/.env
```

**Solution:**
- Verify MySQL credentials in .env
- Check if MySQL service is running
- Test connection with mysql client
- Verify database exists
- Check firewall rules (Hostinger)
