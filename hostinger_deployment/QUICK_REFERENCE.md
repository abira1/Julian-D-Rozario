## 🔧 Backend Setup (Required for Full Functionality)

### Your app needs a Python FastAPI backend for:
- Blog API (reading/creating posts)
- User authentication
- Database operations

### Backend Options:

**Option 1: Hostinger VPS (if you have VPS/Cloud hosting)**
```bash
ssh user@server
cd ~/backend
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001
```

**Option 2: External Service (if Shared Hosting)**
- PythonAnywhere: https://pythonanywhere.com (Free/Paid)
- Railway: https://railway.app (Free tier)
- Render: https://render.com (Free tier)
- DigitalOcean: $5/month

After hosting backend, update API URL:
```env
# In .env (rebuild required)
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=https://your-backend-url.com
```

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### 1. .htaccess Must Be Present
- File: `public_html/.htaccess`
- Purpose: React Router support (SPA routing)
- Without it: Navigation breaks (404 errors)

### 2. HTTPS Required
- Enable Free SSL in Hostinger panel
- Wait 5-10 minutes for activation
- Force HTTPS is configured in .htaccess

### 3. Backend Requirement
- Frontend alone = Static site (no API calls work)
- Full functionality = Frontend + Backend

---

## 🧪 Quick Test

After deployment, run these tests:

```bash
# 1. Homepage
curl -I https://yourdomain.com
# Expected: 200 OK

# 2. React Router
curl -I https://yourdomain.com/blog
# Expected: 200 OK (not 404)

# 3. HTTPS redirect
curl -I http://yourdomain.com
# Expected: 301 redirect to https

# 4. Static files
curl -I https://yourdomain.com/static/js/main.*.js
# Expected: 200 OK

# 5. API (if backend running)
curl https://yourdomain.com/api/health
# Expected: {"status":"healthy"}
```

## 🐛 Common Issues

### Issue: Blank page
**Fix:** Check browser console (F12) for errors

### Issue: 404 on /blog routes
**Fix:** Verify .htaccess is uploaded and readable

### Issue: API errors
**Fix:** Backend not running or wrong API URL

### Issue: Images not loading
**Fix:** Check file permissions and paths
