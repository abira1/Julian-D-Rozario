Hello! I need you to thoroughly test and verify the complete user profile system with database integration for the Julian D'Rozario Portfolio website. This is a full-stack application running locally with React frontend on port 3000 and FastAPI backend on port 8001, using SQLite database for development (with MySQL support ready for production deployment on Hostinger).

First, please verify that the database is properly set up by checking if all 6 tables exist in the SQLite database located at /app/backend/julian_portfolio.db. The tables you need to verify are: blogs, contact_info, user_profiles, blog_likes, blog_saves, and blog_comments. Make sure each table has the correct structure with proper foreign key relationships and that sample data has been loaded automatically. You can check this by running sqlite3 commands or by testing the API health endpoint at http://localhost:8001/api/health which should return a healthy status with database type.

Next, I need you to test the complete user authentication flow end-to-end. Open the application in a browser at http://localhost:3000, click the "Sign In" button, and authenticate using Google (Firebase OAuth). After signing in, verify that a new user profile was automatically created in the user_profiles table with the Firebase UID, email, display name, and photo URL. Check that a JWT token was generated and stored in the browser's localStorage under the key 'firebase_backend_token'. The profile avatar should now appear in the navigation bar, and clicking it should open a dropdown menu with options for My Profile, Liked Blogs, Saved Blogs, My Comments, and Sign Out (plus Admin Panel if you're using an admin email).

Now test all the profile page navigation by clicking on each menu item one by one. When you click "My Profile", it should navigate to /user/profile and display a beautiful dashboard showing the user's information (name, email, photo from Firebase) along with statistics cards showing counts of liked blogs, saved blogs, and comments. The page should NOT redirect back to the homepage - this was a bug that has been fixed by adding proper authentication loading state checks. Similarly, test "Liked Blogs" (/user/liked-blogs), "Saved Blogs" (/user/saved-blogs), and "My Comments" (/user/comments) pages to ensure they all load correctly without any redirect loops. Each page should either display the relevant content or show a nice empty state with a call-to-action button if there's no data yet.

For the blog interaction features, navigate to a blog post and test the like functionality thoroughly. Click the heart/like button and verify that it changes to a filled state, the like counter increments by 1, and most importantly, check in the database that a new entry was created in the blog_likes table with the correct blog_id and user_id. Click the like button again to unlike it, and verify the icon changes back to unfilled state, the counter decrements, and the database entry is removed. Then go to your "Liked Blogs" page to confirm the blog appears there when liked and disappears when unliked. The like count on the blogs table should always match the actual count in the blog_likes table - this is critical for data consistency.

Similarly, test the save/bookmark functionality by clicking the bookmark icon on a blog post. It should toggle between saved and unsaved states, create entries in the blog_saves table, and the saved blog should appear on your "Saved Blogs" page. Make sure there are no duplicate entries in the database due to the UNIQUE constraint on (blog_id, user_id), and test that saving and unsaving the same blog multiple times works correctly as a toggle without creating orphaned records.

For comments, scroll down to the comments section on any blog post and test creating a new comment by typing some text and submitting it. The comment should appear immediately on the page with your name, photo, and timestamp. Verify in the database that the comment was inserted into the blog_comments table with the correct blog_id, user_id, and comment_text. Then test editing your comment by clicking an edit button (if available) - the comment should update in the database with is_edited set to TRUE. Test deleting a comment and verify it's a soft delete, meaning the is_deleted flag is set to TRUE but the record remains in the database. Deleted comments should not appear in the public comments list. Go to your "My Comments" page and verify all your comments across different blog posts are listed there with links back to the original blogs.

Now test the database integrity and relationships. Try to understand how foreign keys work by checking what happens when related data is deleted - for example, if a blog is deleted, all associated likes, saves, and comments should be automatically removed due to CASCADE delete constraints. Similarly, if a user profile is somehow deleted, all their likes, saves, and comments should be cleaned up automatically. Verify that the UNIQUE constraints are working by attempting to like the same blog twice through the API - it should toggle rather than create duplicate entries.

Test all the backend API endpoints using curl commands to make sure they return proper responses. For public endpoints like GET /api/blogs and GET /api/categories, they should work without authentication. For protected endpoints like POST /api/blogs/1/like, GET /api/user/profile, and GET /api/user/liked-blogs, you need to include the JWT token in the Authorization header. Test that endpoints requiring authentication return 401 Unauthorized when called without a token or with an invalid token. Test that admin-only endpoints like POST /api/blogs (create blog) return 403 Forbidden when called by a regular user. Make sure all API responses have the correct structure with proper JSON formatting and appropriate HTTP status codes.

Check the user profile statistics on the profile dashboard and verify they're accurate by counting the actual records in the database. If the stats show "3 Liked Blogs", there should be exactly 3 entries in the blog_likes table for that user. If it shows "5 Comments", there should be 5 non-deleted comments in blog_comments table for that user. The view counter on blogs should increment each time someone views a blog post, and the likes counter should match the count in blog_likes table.

Test error handling thoroughly by trying edge cases like submitting an empty comment (should show validation error), trying to access a non-existent blog ID (should return 404), trying to edit someone else's comment (should return 403 Forbidden), and trying to access profile pages while not logged in (should redirect to homepage after auth loads). Also test with expired or malformed JWT tokens to ensure proper error messages are displayed.

For performance testing, check that API response times are reasonable - blog listing should load in under 200ms, single blog requests under 100ms, and user profile data under 150ms. Test concurrent requests by making multiple API calls simultaneously and verify there are no database deadlocks or connection pool issues. Check that the application handles multiple users interacting at the same time without conflicts.

Test the complete end-to-end user journey from start to finish: Sign in with Google → profile automatically created → navigate to blog page → read a blog → like it → save it → write a comment → go to profile page → see stats updated (1 like, 1 save, 1 comment) → click on "Liked Blogs" stat → see the liked blog → click on it → read it again → unlike it → go back to profile → stats now show 0 likes → go to "Saved Blogs" → blog still there → unsave it → go to "My Comments" → see your comment → edit it → verify "Edited" badge appears → delete the comment → verify it's removed from the list → sign out → sign back in → verify your profile data persists.

Check the browser console (F12) for any JavaScript errors, React warnings, or failed API calls. There should be no errors in the console during normal operation. Check the backend logs at /var/log/supervisor/backend.*.log for any Python errors or database query failures. Check the frontend logs at /var/log/supervisor/frontend.*.log for any compilation errors. All services should be running properly when you check with "sudo supervisorctl status" - backend, frontend, and mongodb should all show RUNNING status.

Finally, verify the MySQL migration script is ready for production deployment by reviewing the /app/database_migration.sql file. It should contain all 6 table definitions with proper column types, indexes, foreign key constraints, and sample data inserts. The DATABASE_SETUP_GUIDE.md should have clear step-by-step instructions for running this script on Hostinger's phpMyAdmin, and the backend server.py should support switching between SQLite and MySQL by changing the DATABASE_TYPE environment variable.

If everything works correctly, the user should be able to sign in, interact with blogs (like, save, comment), view all their activity on dedicated profile pages, see accurate statistics, edit and delete their own content, and have all this data persist correctly in the database with proper relationships and constraints. The navigation should be smooth with no unexpected redirects, the UI should be responsive and beautiful with loading states, and all the backend APIs should return proper responses with authentication and authorization working correctly. Please document any issues you find with severity levels, and create a comprehensive test report using the template provided in COMPREHENSIVE_TESTING_PROMPT.md. Make sure to test on both desktop and mobile viewport sizes to verify the responsive design works properly. Thank you!
