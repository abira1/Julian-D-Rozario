## üêõ Troubleshooting:

### Issue: Still showing "0 blogs" on homepage

**Solution 1:** Check database
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM blogs WHERE status = 'published';
UPDATE blogs SET status = 'published' WHERE status != 'published';
```

**Solution 2:** Clear browser cache
- Press Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
- Or use incognito/private mode

### Issue: Images not loading

**Check 1:** Database has image URLs
```sql
SELECT id, image_url FROM blogs WHERE image_url IS NULL;
-- If any results, update them:
UPDATE blogs 
SET image_url = 'https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1486406146926-c627a92ad1ab?w=800&h=400&fit=crop'
WHERE image_url IS NULL;
```

**Check 2:** Image URLs are valid
- All sample blogs use Unsplash CDN
- These are free and permanent links
- Should load immediately

### Issue: Blog detail page still shows error

**Check 1:** Updated frontend files uploaded
- Verify `static/js/main.[hash].js` file timestamp
- Should be recent (after this fix)

**Check 2:** Clear browser cache completely
- Use incognito mode to test
- Or clear all cache and reload

**Check 3:** Check browser console
- Look for specific JavaScript errors
- Note the error message and check against fixes

### Issue: API returns 500 error

**Check 1:** Database connection
```php
// In phpMyAdmin, test connection
SELECT 1;  -- Should return 1
```

**Check 2:** PHP error logs
- Hostinger control panel ‚Üí Error Logs
- Look for recent PHP errors
