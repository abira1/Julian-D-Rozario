## 🔥 QUICK FIX - Follow These Steps:

### Step 1: Add Missing Image Columns to Database

**Option A: Using phpMyAdmin (Recommended)**

1. Log into your Hostinger control panel
2. Go to **phpMyAdmin**
3. Select database: `u691568332_toiraldbhub`
4. Click on **SQL** tab
5. Copy and paste the contents of `add_image_columns.sql` file
6. Click **Go** to execute

**Option B: Using MySQL Command Line**

```bash

# Password: Toiral185#4
```

### Step 2: Add Sample Blog Posts (IMPORTANT!)

After adding the image columns, you need to populate the database with blog posts.

**Using phpMyAdmin:**

1. In phpMyAdmin, select your database
2. Click on **SQL** tab
3. Run this query to check current blogs:
   ```sql
   SELECT id, title, image_url FROM blogs;
   ```

4. If you have no blogs or want to add more, copy the INSERT statements from `database_setup.sql` (lines 149-265)
5. Paste and execute them in the SQL tab

---

### Step 3: Verify the Fix

1. **Check Database Structure:**
   ```sql
   DESCRIBE blogs;
   ```
   You should see `image_url` and `featured_image` columns

2. **Check Blog Count:**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) as blog_count FROM blogs WHERE status = 'published';
   ```
   Should show at least 6 blogs

3. **Check Sample Data:**
   ```sql
   SELECT id, title, category, image_url, status FROM blogs LIMIT 5;
   ```
   All blogs should have image URLs

---

### Step 4: Test Your Website

1. Go to **https://drozario.blog**
2. Scroll to "Latest Insights" section - should show 6 blog posts with images
3. Click on any blog post - should open the detailed page without errors
4. Verify all images are loading correctly

## 📁 Files Included:

1. **add_image_columns.sql** - Adds missing image columns (RUN THIS FIRST!)
2. **database_setup.sql** - Complete database setup with sample blogs
3. **public_html/** - Updated PHP API files (already correct)

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes:

1. **Backup First**: Always backup your database before running SQL scripts
2. **Image URLs**: The sample blogs use Unsplash images - they're free and will work immediately
3. **Custom Images**: To add your own images later, use the admin panel at `/julian_portfolio`

## 🔧 Troubleshooting:

### Issue: "Column already exists" error
**Solution**: The columns might already be there. Skip Step 1 and go to Step 2.

### Issue: Still showing zero blogs
**Solution**: 
1. Check if blogs are marked as 'published':
   ```sql
   UPDATE blogs SET status = 'published';
   ```
2. Clear browser cache and refresh

### Issue: Images still not loading
**Solution**:
1. Check if image_url column has values:
   ```sql
   SELECT id, title, image_url FROM blogs WHERE image_url IS NULL;
   ```
2. Update null images:
   ```sql
   UPDATE blogs 
   SET image_url = 'https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1486406146926-c627a92ad1ab?w=800&h=400&fit=crop'
   WHERE image_url IS NULL;
   ```
