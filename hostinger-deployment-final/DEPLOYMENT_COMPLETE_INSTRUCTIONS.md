# üöÄ Complete Deployment Instructions for Hostinger

## ‚úÖ What's Been Fixed:

1. **Added Image Columns**: `image_url` and `featured_image` columns added to blogs table
2. **Sample Blog Data**: 6 professional blog posts with high-quality Unsplash images
3. **Updated Database Schema**: Complete MySQL schema with all required fields
4. **PHP API Updated**: Ready to serve blogs with images
5. **Frontend Compatible**: All frontend components will now receive image URLs

---

## üì¶ Files to Deploy to Hostinger:

### 1. Database Files (Run these on your MySQL database):
- **`add_image_columns.sql`** - Adds missing columns to existing database (if tables exist)
- **`database_setup.sql`** - Complete fresh setup (if starting from scratch)

### 2. API Files (Upload to `/public_html/api/`):
- All files in `public_html/api/` folder are already updated
- No changes needed to PHP files - they already handle image fields correctly

### 3. Frontend Files:
- Upload entire `public_html/` folder (except database files)
- This includes the React build with all assets

---

## üéØ Step-by-Step Deployment:

### Step 1: Access Your Hostinger Control Panel
1. Log in to https://hpanel.hostinger.com
2. Navigate to your website: **drozario.blog**

### Step 2: Update Database Schema

**Option A: If you already have a blogs table** (Recommended)
```sql
-- Run this in phpMyAdmin SQL tab
USE u691568332_toiraldbhub;

-- Add image columns
ALTER TABLE blogs 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS image_url VARCHAR(500) NULL AFTER content,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS featured_image VARCHAR(500) NULL AFTER image_url;

-- Update existing blogs with placeholder images
UPDATE blogs 
SET image_url = 'https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1486406146926-c627a92ad1ab?w=800&h=400&fit=crop'
WHERE image_url IS NULL OR image_url = '';

UPDATE blogs 
SET featured_image = image_url
WHERE featured_image IS NULL OR featured_image = '';
```

**Option B: Fresh Database Setup**
1. Go to phpMyAdmin
2. Select database: `u691568332_toiraldbhub`
3. Import entire `database_setup.sql` file
   - This will create all tables with sample data
   - Safe to run - uses `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`

### Step 3: Add Sample Blog Posts

If you don't have enough blog posts, run the INSERT statements from `database_setup.sql` (lines 149-265).

Copy and paste these in phpMyAdmin SQL tab:

```sql
USE u691568332_toiraldbhub;

-- Then paste all the INSERT INTO blogs statements from database_setup.sql
-- This will add 6 professional blog posts with images
```

### Step 4: Verify Database Changes

Run these verification queries in phpMyAdmin:

```sql
-- Check table structure
DESCRIBE blogs;
-- Should show image_url and featured_image columns

-- Check blog count  
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM blogs WHERE status = 'published';
-- Should show at least 6 blogs

-- Check images are present
SELECT id, title, category, image_url FROM blogs LIMIT 5;
-- All blogs should have image URLs
```

### Step 5: Upload Website Files (If Needed)

If you need to update the frontend:

1. In Hostinger control panel, go to **File Manager**
2. Navigate to `/public_html/`
3. Upload/replace files from the `public_html/` folder
4. Ensure `.htaccess` is in place for React routing

### Step 6: Test Your Website

1. **Test API Endpoint:**
   - Visit: https://drozario.blog/api/blogs
   - Should return JSON with blog list including image URLs

2. **Test Homepage:**
   - Visit: https://drozario.blog
   - Scroll to "Latest Insights" section
   - Should show 6 blog posts with images

3. **Test Blog Detail Page:**
   - Click on any blog post
   - Should open detail page with full content and image
   - URL format: https://drozario.blog/blog/1

4. **Check Browser Console:**
   - Press F12 to open Developer Tools
   - Check Console tab for any errors
   - Check Network tab to see API calls

## üîç Troubleshooting Guide:

### Issue: "Column already exists" Error
**Solution:** The columns are already there. Skip adding columns and just insert blog data.

### Issue: Still showing zero blogs on homepage
**Check:**
```sql
-- Are blogs published?
SELECT id, title, status FROM blogs;

-- Update status if needed
UPDATE blogs SET status = 'published';
```

### Issue: Images not loading
**Check:**
```sql
-- Do blogs have image URLs?
SELECT id, title, image_url FROM blogs;

-- Add images if missing
UPDATE blogs 
SET image_url = 'https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1486406146926-c627a92ad1ab?w=800&h=400&fit=crop'
WHERE image_url IS NULL;
```

### Issue: Blog detail page shows error
**Check:**
1. API endpoint working: https://drozario.blog/api/blogs/1
2. Blog content has valid HTML
3. Browser console for JavaScript errors

### Issue: API returns 500 error
**Check:**
1. Database credentials in `/public_html/api/config.php` are correct
2. Database connection is working
3. Check PHP error logs in Hostinger control panel

---

## üìä Database Credentials (Already Configured):

```php
DB_HOST: localhost
DB_NAME: u691568332_toiraldbhub
DB_USER: u691568332_Juliandrozario  
DB_PASS: Toiral185#4
```

These are already set in `/public_html/api/config.php` - no need to change.
